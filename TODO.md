1. Extract all global functions to a private API (keep them there for now)
2. Branch logic on VR and use PapyrusUtil for SSE
3. Track the Nth cuz that's cool
4. Set verbosity (whether messages show up )
5. Trigger automatically via SKSE
6. Trigger automatically via Config






- Track the Nth index for selectors which have duplicates on the page
- Can use SKSE mod events to run Recordings, Steps, or Actions
- Can put recording name(s) into a config file which will AUTOMATICALLY run the recordings!





- Can detect is a field is on the page easily (and get it)
