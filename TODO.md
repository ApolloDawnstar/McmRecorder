- [x] Extract all global functions to a private API (keep them there for now)
- [ ] Track the Nth cuz that's cool
- [ ] Branch logic on VR and use PapyrusUtil for SSE
- [ ] Set verbosity (whether messages show up )
- [ ] Trigger automatically via SKSE
- [ ] Trigger automatically via Config

- Track the Nth index for selectors which have duplicates on the page
- Can use SKSE mod events to run Recordings, Steps, or Actions
- Can put recording name(s) into a config file which will AUTOMATICALLY run the recordings!
- Can detect is a field is on the page easily (and get it)

TODO: MCM translation files

BUG: in VR when you click 'begin recording' if says 'Choose Recording To Play' even if there are none
